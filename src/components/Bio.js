            <p>Hi! I'm Michael. I'm a full stack developer building open source educational, entertainment, and cryptocurrency products.</p>
            <h2>Team Leadership</h2>
            <p>As a Team Lead in Lambda School's WEB program, I mentor new web developers through their first taste of HTML/CSS/Javascript, all the way through their first React and Node apps. Along the way I also am a PM for student builds, basically week-long hackathons where cross-functional teams apply what they've learned to building a real app in an Agile team environment.</p>
